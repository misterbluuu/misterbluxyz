        <p>
          I’ve struggled for a while to find something that I felt like only I could do. My
          self-confidence sort of dropped as I went through the classic pipeline of “gifted kid in
          primary school to absolute trainwreck in college.” My grades were dogwater. My study
          strategy was don’t go to class at all ever and then cram all of the content of a 12-week
          fluid dynamics course into a single 2-hour study session before the final. I always sort
          of knew I wasn’t built for school, but college was a wake-up call like no other. It’s not
          like I didn’t want to learn — I really did — but sitting and listening to someone yap for
          2 hours straight was equivalent to torture for me.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          What did I spend my 4 years in college doing if not going to class, you may ask? Literally
          anything and everything else. I worked 2 jobs at a time (almost) my entire college career,
          I founded multiple clubs (and held officer positions in others), I went to networking
          events and conferences. I was consistently on campus 14 hours a day without ever stepping
          in a classroom. In any free time I had, I hung out off the clock at either of the 2
          makerspaces I worked at on campus. I loved it there. The community, the machines, the
          serene sound of the 3D printers running through the night as I sat in the lab cramming
          class projects. It felt like home. I found a real passion for helping people take ideas
          from abstract concepts into real, tangible products. I put a lot of energy into other
          people’s dreams, and I loved every second of it. Though sometimes I thought of myself as
          that guy who “leads others to a treasure that I cannot possess.” Support class to the max.
          I always knew that I would eventually need to follow my own path, but I never thought the
          time to do that would come so soon.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          I (barely) graduated this May, and by some miracle got a job. One week I had no idea what
          I was going to do over the summer for work, and literally the next I was 3,000 miles away
          from home in a hacker house of 18 people in Silicon Valley at a robotics start up. Anyone
          who knows me will tell you if there is something I am absolutely over the moon about to
          the point that I “light up” when talking about it, it’s robotics. I can’t exactly explain
          why I ended up fixated on robots specifically, but once I started diving into it, I got
          obsessed. I did multiple internships in high school related to robotics, became head coder
          of the robotics club, went full send in every way possible. It seemed like a dream come
          true to work at a company specializing in building the first generation of autonomous home
          robots right out of college.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          I don’t entirely hate my current job (most of the time). I still get to build things, and
          I’m working full time as support for the engineering team, even if I’m not a “real”
          engineer. I really do think our product is (going to eventually be) good and that the
          company is doing cool stuff, but I just don’t feel that fire burning within me about it the
          way I did with other robotics stuff I did in college. This issue was made way worse after
          piloting the fighting robot for Silicon Colosseum and eventually helping Caeden do the
          first ever humanoid robot skydive. Building vacuum cleaner robots just doesn’t hit the same
          after that I fear.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          During my time in Chicago for the skydive project, I was around a lot of people who went
          all in on their dreams. They found something they loved to do, and centered their entire
          life around it. I also jumped out of an airplane. Both of these experiences really got me
          thinking. If other people can go all in on their dreams as soon as they figure them out,
          why can’t I? Is doing something as insane as quitting my full time job to do what I truly
          love scarier than falling 13,500 ft? The conclusion I came to is that it is not (I’m sort
          of lying, skydiving was rad as hell and I wasn’t really scared of it at all but you get the
          point).
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          After I got back from the trip I did some serious pondering about what I wanted to do with
          my life. The first place I started was “what do I absolutely hate more than anything in the
          world that I think should be changed?”. The second was “what do I love doing?”. I was
          pretty quickly reminded of an idea I had a while ago that incorporated my answers to both
          of those questions. I was in the EE lab at work and we were trying to figure out what to do
          with a ton of electronics we didn’t have space for, and one of the engineers was like “when
          in doubt, throw it out”. To very expensive, still functioning hardware. This is not the
          first time I’ve seen this happen. I may or may not have done some dumpster diving a while
          ago for some really nice motors I knew still worked fine that were thrown out because the
          company just didn’t really have a use for them. Before I ended up swamped in other work I
          had been spending some time trying to figure out the logistics of donating these parts
          instead of just trashing them. The stuff that was thrown out wasn’t only one off
          prototyping parts, but a consistent stream of motors that failed quality checks due to
          noise but otherwise worked fine. I thought it might be cool to set up a system where we
          partner with a makerspace nearby that is designated as a nonprofit and donate stuff to them
          in return for government issued tax breaks.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          That then developed into an idea of a website or app that partnered hardware companies with
          makerspaces or individuals. I told my fellow hacker housemates about it, and the first
          thing one of them said was “there’s no profit model for that”. Which was entirely accurate,
          at the time at least. Fun fact about me is that I’m not very money motivated when it comes
          to doing stuff (if I was, I definitely wouldn't be working where I work now LMAO). As long
          as I can afford rent and food and to go do Fun Things Out On the Town on occasion, I’m
          chilling. Either way, my intention was not to make money doing this. I was just pissed that
          so much good hardware was going to waste. In fact I was ready to put some of my own money
          into it to host the server or whatever (idfk how websites work (can you tell?)) was needed.
          I genuinely just wanted to support my maker community members and help alleviate the global
          waste crisis a little bit in the process.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          I didn’t end up building the website at that point because work got insane (we love toxic
          start-up grind culture) and also a lot of things were happening in the hacker house and I
          wasn’t really in the right headspace to jump into it. I definitely kept thinking about it
          though. Surely there was a way to make it work.

        <div className="section-title-sticker">Mission</div>
        <p>
          I’m not looking to just start a company—I’m looking to start a movement. Coding has become
          easier than ever before, allowing anyone to build software. What we need now is to make
          hardware just as accessible. By rethinking how we handle discarded hardware, we can empower
          creators, students, and engineers to innovate without barriers. </p>
<p>.</p>
          <p>This needs to be done in a strategic manner, though. While there are currently ways to buy new 
          hardware at low prices (with even lower quality) and get it with overnight shipping, it causes a 
          lot of waste. The packaging, the emissions required to ship something to the other side of the globe,
           the contribution to the landfill when the part breaks because it’s shitty and it gets thrown out. This
            project would be extremely flawed if more waste was created in an effort to avoid it. I want to ensure
             that anything I do is a net positive on the environmental impact.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I’m also looking to get people excited about hardware. The AI boom has drawn many young professionals to the software
 field, but the other engineering disciplines (specifically EE) are being left behind. Software can only be as good as
  the hardware running it, so the need for exceptional hardware engineers is only growing. I want to show the next generation
   of engineers how cool hardware can be, and how much of an impact its innovation can have on our future as a species. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to use this movement as a call to reform how we look at education, specifically in STEM. Programming classes
 and software engineering degrees are becoming obsolete in the age of “vibe coding”. Even math up to a certain degree will
  soon be heavily powered by AI. Something that can’t be done entirely online is bringing hands-on hardware learning to students
   of all ages. Everyone knows even if teachers have the best of intentions, their resources can only go so far. I want to help
    them be able to supply students with all sorts of hardware both to facilitate active learning, and to make learning fun.

          <li>Reduce manufacturing waste.</li>
          <li>
            Provide affordable hardware to people who want to create—especially students and makers
            who can’t afford expensive equipment.
          </li>
          <li>Get people excited about robotics and hands-on engineering.</li>
          <li>
            Elevate hardware learning to the same level of accessibility as software education.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the way we view waste by showing how discarded components can become tools for
            innovation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reimagine education, encouraging schools and communities to integrate hands-on hardware
            creation into their environments.
