        <p>
          I’ve struggled for a while to find something that I felt like only I could do. My
          self-confidence sort of dropped as I went through the classic pipeline of “gifted kid in
          primary school to absolute trainwreck in college.” My grades were dogwater. My study
          strategy was don’t go to class at all ever and then cram all of the content of a 12-week
          fluid dynamics course into a single 2-hour study session before the final. I always sort
          of knew I wasn’t built for school, but college was a wake-up call like no other. It’s not
          like I didn’t want to learn — I really did — but sitting and listening to someone yap for
          2 hours straight was equivalent to torture for me.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          What did I spend my 4 years in college doing if not going to class, you may ask? Literally
          anything and everything else. I worked 2 jobs at a time (almost) my entire college career,
          I founded multiple clubs (and held officer positions in others), I went to networking
          events and conferences. I was consistently on campus 14 hours a day without ever stepping
          in a classroom. In any free time I had, I hung out off the clock at either of the 2
          makerspaces I worked at on campus. I loved it there. The community, the machines, the
          serene sound of the 3D printers running through the night as I sat in the lab cramming
          class projects. It felt like home. I found a real passion for helping people take ideas
          from abstract concepts into real, tangible products. I put a lot of energy into other
          people’s dreams, and I loved every second of it. Though sometimes I thought of myself as
          that guy who “leads others to a treasure that I cannot possess.” Support class to the max.
          I always knew that I would eventually need to follow my own path, but I never thought the
          time to do that would come so soon.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          I (barely) graduated this May, and by some miracle got a job. One week I had no idea what
          I was going to do over the summer for work, and literally the next I was 3,000 miles away
          from home in a hacker house of 18 people in Silicon Valley at a robotics start up. Anyone
          who knows me will tell you if there is something I am absolutely over the moon about to
          the point that I “light up” when talking about it, it’s robotics. I can’t exactly explain
          why I ended up fixated on robots specifically, but once I started diving into it, I got
          obsessed. I did multiple internships in high school related to robotics, became head coder
          of the robotics club, went full send in every way possible. It seemed like a dream come
          true to work at a company specializing in building the first generation of autonomous home
          robots right out of college.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          I don’t entirely hate my current job (most of the time). I still get to build things, and
          I’m working full time as support for the engineering team, even if I’m not a “real”
          engineer. I really do think our product is (going to eventually be) good and that the
          company is doing cool stuff, but I just don’t feel that fire burning within me about it the
          way I did with other robotics stuff I did in college. This issue was made way worse after
          piloting the fighting robot for Silicon Colosseum and eventually helping Caeden do the
          first ever humanoid robot skydive. Building vacuum cleaner robots just doesn’t hit the same
          after that I fear.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          During my time in Chicago for the skydive project, I was around a lot of people who went
          all in on their dreams. They found something they loved to do, and centered their entire
          life around it. I also jumped out of an airplane. Both of these experiences really got me
          thinking. If other people can go all in on their dreams as soon as they figure them out,
          why can’t I? Is doing something as insane as quitting my full time job to do what I truly
          love scarier than falling 13,500 ft? The conclusion I came to is that it is not (I’m sort
          of lying, skydiving was rad as hell and I wasn’t really scared of it at all but you get the
          point).
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          After I got back from the trip I did some serious pondering about what I wanted to do with
          my life. The first place I started was “what do I absolutely hate more than anything in the
          world that I think should be changed?”. The second was “what do I love doing?”. I was
          pretty quickly reminded of an idea I had a while ago that incorporated my answers to both
          of those questions. I was in the EE lab at work and we were trying to figure out what to do
          with a ton of electronics we didn’t have space for, and one of the engineers was like “when
          in doubt, throw it out”. To very expensive, still functioning hardware. This is not the
          first time I’ve seen this happen. I may or may not have done some dumpster diving a while
          ago for some really nice motors I knew still worked fine that were thrown out because the
          company just didn’t really have a use for them. Before I ended up swamped in other work I
          had been spending some time trying to figure out the logistics of donating these parts
          instead of just trashing them. The stuff that was thrown out wasn’t only one off
          prototyping parts, but a consistent stream of motors that failed quality checks due to
          noise but otherwise worked fine. I thought it might be cool to set up a system where we
          partner with a makerspace nearby that is designated as a nonprofit and donate stuff to them
          in return for government issued tax breaks.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          That then developed into an idea of a website or app that partnered hardware companies with
          makerspaces or individuals. I told my fellow hacker housemates about it, and the first
          thing one of them said was “there’s no profit model for that”. Which was entirely accurate,
          at the time at least. Fun fact about me is that I’m not very money motivated when it comes
          to doing stuff (if I was, I definitely wouldn't be working where I work now LMAO). As long
          as I can afford rent and food and to go do Fun Things Out On the Town on occasion, I’m
          chilling. Either way, my intention was not to make money doing this. I was just pissed that
          so much good hardware was going to waste. In fact I was ready to put some of my own money
          into it to host the server or whatever (idfk how websites work (can you tell?)) was needed.
          I genuinely just wanted to support my maker community members and help alleviate the global
          waste crisis a little bit in the process.
        </p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>
          I didn’t end up building the website at that point because work got insane (we love toxic
          start-up grind culture) and also a lot of things were happening in the hacker house and I
          wasn’t really in the right headspace to jump into it. I definitely kept thinking about it
          though. Surely there was a way to make it work.

      <div className="section-box">
        <div className="section-title-sticker">Mission</div>
        <p>
          I’m not looking to just start a company—I’m looking to start a movement. Coding has become
          easier than ever before, allowing anyone to build software. What we need now is to make
          hardware just as accessible. By rethinking how we handle discarded hardware, we can empower
          creators, students, and engineers to innovate without barriers. </p>
<p>.</p>
          <p>This needs to be done in a strategic manner, though. While there are currently ways to buy new 
          hardware at low prices (with even lower quality) and get it with overnight shipping, it causes a 
          lot of waste. The packaging, the emissions required to ship something to the other side of the globe,
           the contribution to the landfill when the part breaks because it’s shitty and it gets thrown out. This
            project would be extremely flawed if more waste was created in an effort to avoid it. I want to ensure
             that anything I do is a net positive on the environmental impact.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I’m also looking to get people excited about hardware. The AI boom has drawn many young professionals to the software
 field, but the other engineering disciplines (specifically EE) are being left behind. Software can only be as good as
  the hardware running it, so the need for exceptional hardware engineers is only growing. I want to show the next generation
   of engineers how cool hardware can be, and how much of an impact its innovation can have on our future as a species. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to use this movement as a call to reform how we look at education, specifically in STEM. Programming classes
 and software engineering degrees are becoming obsolete in the age of “vibe coding”. Even math up to a certain degree will
  soon be heavily powered by AI. Something that can’t be done entirely online is bringing hands-on hardware learning to students
   of all ages. Everyone knows even if teachers have the best of intentions, their resources can only go so far. I want to help
    them be able to supply students with all sorts of hardware both to facilitate active learning, and to make learning fun.

      <div className="section-box">
        <div className="section-title-sticker">Act I: The Small Stuff</div>
        <p>As much as I would love to immediately jump into facilitating a global hardware revolution, changing the
             world can’t be done in a day. It needs to be a long and methodical process, so I’ve split up my Grand Plan
              into “Acts”, focusing first on establishing a proof of concept in the most likely place for this all to work:
               the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I think the best way to start this project is to establish a repertoire with current start-ups/companies and makerspaces
     locally when it comes to the one-off waste. My current start-up currently has a pretty serious random items issue. We
      have an entire room dedicated to “just throwing” stuff in it. I think it might be a good idea to try reaching out to hardware
       companies from the angle of “hey, you have a lot of random shit? We can take it off your hands, and clean up your space a 
       little in the process”. Ideally, this would be a paid service of some sort, but cheap compared to hiring an actual cleaning 
       service. Either way, it would be a mutually beneficial transaction that would allow the acquisition of hardware that would 
       have likely just been thrown out otherwise. I also plan to try to advertise a way for individuals to donate hardware if they
        feel so inclined. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p> The next step is taking what I do get and seeing what of it is actually usable. I am aware that distributing hardware deemed
     by a company to be “trash” could potentially be a liability issue, but I will not let anything get passed on that’s not safe.
      This is going to be a major pain point in the beginning I think, at least until I can establish a database of “here’s this motor 
      and here’s how to check if it’s functional and safe”. I’m aware a non-negligible amount of hardware I acquire will likely be 
      beyond repair and that I will need to find something to do with it. This is specifically important when it comes to batteries
      , as they are hard to dispose of properly. I plan to extensively research the correct way to recycle/donate anything I might
       end up with to minimize environmental impact. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p> Once I have a collection of good hardware, the next step is to figure out how to get it to people. My original idea was to make 
    some sort of online Facebook Marketplace type thing specifically for hardware. The issue is I don’t want to be selling this. I
     want whatever hardware I save to be as close to entirely free as possible. While I think the marketplace is definitely something
      I plan to work on and try to figure out in the future, I think the first thing I can feasibly do is once I get enough 
      hardware is host some hackathons with it in the Bay Area. While I am looking to find a way to get people individually passionate
       about hardware, I also want to build a community of super passionate hardware enthusiasts, and what better way than a little 
       friendly competition? People in the Bay like doing Fun Nerdy Things, so I think between my current network, some meetup/event
        posting apps, and a bunch of silly posters put up in the downtown areas of a few cities I think it should be easy to garner
         attention. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p> I also want to stick to my roots and try to figure out if there are makerspaces or STEM education programs in the area
 that would benefit from recycled hardware. This would either be in the form of donations to an electronics lab, or hosting 
 proper “hey we have a lot of these motors, lets teach kids how to build funny little machines out of them”. I found 
 out through being an Outdoor School (5th grade environmental camp) Counselor that I love teaching kids about things
  I’m passionate about and getting them excited about STEM, so this is something I could confidently do.
